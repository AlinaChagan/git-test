I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring

And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights


I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love

--------------------------------------

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
